# Into the Wild

People visit National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries expecting to witness some of the rarest flora and fauna available out there, but often end up seeing just some of the common animals. This infuriates people and ruins their experience.</br>
Our tool helps in solving this problem. Here you just have to choose the animal and it will provide all the locations of that animal present in the National Park on a map. The user can choose the desired location and get its directions on Google Maps.</br>
